# EUR/INR Currency Data Analysis
This repository contains code and data for analyzing historical exchange rates between the Euro (EUR) and the Indian Rupee (INR). Weâ€™ll use Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to explore the data, visualize trends, and draw insights.

# Project Structure
data/: Contains historical EUR/INR exchange rate data (CSV files).
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis.
scripts/: Python scripts for data manipulation and visualization.
README.md: This file.
Getting Started
Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/pugazhendhi-github/Yahoo_Finance_currency_analysis.git
cd EUR-INR-currency-analysis

# Install Dependencies:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib

# Explore the Data:
Load the EUR/INR exchange rate data.
Clean and preprocess the data (handle missing values, outliers, etc.).
# Analyze Trends:
Calculate statistical measures (mean, median, variance, etc.).
Identify patterns or anomalies.
# Visualize Results:
Create line plots, scatter plots, or bar charts.
Use Matplotlib to visualize exchange rate trends over time.
# Notebooks
EUR_INR_Analysis.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with step-by-step analysis.
Feel free to create additional notebooks for specific analyses.

# Moving Averages (MA):
Simple Moving Average (SMA): Calculates the average price over a specified period (e.g., 50 days). A bullish signal occurs when the current price crosses above the SMA, and a bearish signal when it crosses below.
Exponential Moving Average (EMA): Similar to SMA but gives more weight to recent prices. EMA crossovers can indicate buy or sell opportunities.

# Relative strength index

Relative Strength Index (RSI):
RSI measures the strength and speed of price movements. Values above 70 indicate overbought conditions (potential sell signal), while values below 30 suggest oversold conditions (potential buy signal).
# Bollinger Bands:
Consists of an upper band (standard deviation above the moving average) and a lower band (standard deviation below). Price crossing the bands can signal buy or sell opportunities.
