Finance-Flash Currency Analysis

Objective:
The objective of this project is to analyze the trend of EUR/INR currency pair for the upcoming day and week using technical indicators.

1. Python Script:
The Python script named finance_flash_currency_analysis.py performs the following tasks:

    Scrapes EUR/INR currency data from Yahoo Finance covering the period from January 1, 2023, to February 16, 2024.
    Conducts technical analysis and calculates Moving Average, Bollinger Band, and CCI for one day and one week from February 16, 2024.
    Makes trading decisions (BUY, SELL, NEUTRAL) based on the results of each individual indicator.

2. PowerPoint Presentation:
